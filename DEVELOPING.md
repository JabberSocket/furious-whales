# Ubuntu

Install pygame_sdl2 https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2

sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev libsdl2-dev \
    libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
    libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev virtualenvwrapper

I had to use aptitude to get libsdl2-dev installed due to some libpulse-dev issues.
